- Update your system and then install following modules:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install wget python3 bluetooth python3-pip libglib2.0-dev -y
sudo pip install bluepy
```

- Modify file ```sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.target.wants/bluetooth.service```:

```
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --noplugin=sap
```

### 4. Configure the script
- Update the first few lines of the ```sudo nano scan_xiaomi_scale.py``` with your MAC address (scale_mac_addr)
